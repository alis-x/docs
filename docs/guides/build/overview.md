# Overview

**alis.exchange** enables individuals and organisations to move from simply writing code to building enterprise-grade software. 
In this section we provide an overview of the process to build products on **alis.exchange**. A product on **alis.exchange** is what is 
offered to the world and consists of one or more underlying services which provide the functionality of the product. 

In this overview, it is the building of these underlying services which we are interested in. The high-level process that is followed
when creating services are depicted below.

Each of the steps are explained in the following sections and follow the structure:<br>
👨‍💻 **User actions** - the actions that are required from the user;<br>
🏗 **alis.exchange** - what is facilitated by us in the background; and<br>
🚀 **End result** - what the output of the step is.
