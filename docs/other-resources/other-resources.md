# Other Resources

## Protocol buffers
Protocol buffers, commonly referred to as _protos_, provide the interface definition language. 

Protos are the golden source of truth of anything we do on the **alis.exchange**. Starting with protos eliminates common sources of developer toil by:
- Auto-generating documentation for APIs
- Auto-generating source code for the majority of popular languages including Go, Java, Python and more
- Auto-generating equivalent REST endpoints for gRPC services

Further reading on protos:
- [Protocol buffers documentation](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)

## gRPC
gRPC is the primary inter-process communication protocol used on **alis.exchange** and is widely adopted by large companies
such as [Google, Netflix and Square](https://grpc.io/about/#whos-using-grpc-and-why").
As explained in the excellent book [gRPC: Up & Running]("https://www.amazon.com/gRPC-Running-Building-Applications-Kubernetes/dp/1492058335")
(pages 10-13):

> Modern software applications rarely operate in isolation. Rather, they are connected with each other through computer
> networks and communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another. Therefore, a modern software
> system is a collection of distributed software applications that are running at different network locations and
> communicate with each other with message passing using different communication protocols.
>
> Inter-process communications are usually implemented using message passing with a synchronous request-response style
> or asynchronous event-driven styles.
>
> When it comes to building synchronous request-response style communication for modern cloud native applications and
> microservices, the most common and conventional approach is to build them as RESTful services ...
> however, for most use cases RESTful services are quite bulky,

## Terraform
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) software framework. 
Terraform codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files. On **alis.exchange** this means we never spend time tinkering with infrastructure in a console.

## Git
On **alis.exchange**, we use Git as the version control system and integrate with it to control builds of your products
and neurons. We are pattern agnostic, so whether you use a _feature branch_ workflow, _trunk-based development_ or any
other pattern, you will be able to develop on **alis.exchange** as long as Git is used.

If you are not familiar with Git, you can check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE" target="_blank">

## Google Cloud Platform

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, Google Drive, and YouTube. Alongside a set of management tools, it provides a series of modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics and machine learning.

Check out [_Essentials of GCP_ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D3X6Xl5c_Y) for an overview of their services.

## Go
Go is an open source programming language supported by Google. 
The language is a great place for building _"fast, reliable, and efficient software at scale"_. 

The highlights of Go are that it's easy to learn, strongly typed and makes concurrency simple to implement.
