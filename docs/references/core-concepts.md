# Core concepts

**alis.exchange** has a collection of resources that follow the best practices of resource-oriented design. 
These resources are used to elegantly integrate cloud technologies that make up the **alis.exhange** platform. The three most important resources are depicted in the image below.

![](../.vuepress/public/assets/images/resourceHierarchy.svg)

The three major resources can be communicated together as an `organisation` having one or more `product`,
consisting of one or more `neuron`. Additionally, `products` have `deployments`, which consists of all, or a subset, of the
`neurons`.
## Organisation

An `organisation` resource represents the top-level resource on **alis.exchange**.

- _Conceptually_, all `products` built on the exchange belong to a specific `organisation`.
- _Practically_, an `organisation`:
	- Is responsible for billing.
	- Owns and manages users in the organisation along with access management.
	- Has a monorepo in which all resource and service definitions well as infrastructure specification contained.
## Product

A `product` resource represents a digital product built on **alis.exchange**. The majority of these adopt an API-first strategy.

- _Conceptually_, a `product` is the thing which is offered to the world, whether for usage within an `organisation` or
  as a B2B/B2C product.
- _Practically_, the `product`:
    - Has its own Google Cloud project.
    - Has a repo in which the source code for the `product` is contained.
    - Consists of a group of developers.
    - Can have one or more deployments of the `product`.
    - Manages access to the deployments of the `product`. This may be on an individual or group level.
    - Will specify the various APIs and infrastructure required by the children `neurons` through using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs).

Example `products` on alis.exchange built by <a href="https://alis.capital" target="_blank">alis</a> include:
- `DE`: _Data Engineering_, responsible for synchronising data from external sources.
- `CP`: _Compliance_, a fast and flexible framework for accurate portfolio compliance at scale.

Furthermore, **alis.exchange** itself is a product, `EX`, which delivers its value through leveraging other products
such as `OS`, the _operating system_ facilitating all the resource **alis.exchange** resource management; and `CL`, the
_command-line interface_ which provides a means to interact with `OS` from your terminal.

## Neuron

A `neuron` resource represents the _unit of compute_ used by the parent `product`. Each `neuron` is either a
_resource_ type or a _service_ type. The collection of `neurons` in a `product` - ie. the resources,
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/standard_methods#:~:text=This%20chapter%20defines%20the%20concept%20of%20standard%20methods%2C%20which%20are%20List%2C%20Get%2C%20Create%2C%20Update%2C%20and%20Delete" target="_blank">
methods on the resources</a> and the services (typically following <a href="https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/custom_methods" target="_blank">
custom methods</a>) - provide all the functionality that a `product` requires to provide its offering.

## Deployments

A _deployment_ refers to an operational instance of a `product` on the cloud which clients would interact with. Under the hood this consists of both
`product deployments` and `neuron deployments`.

### Product deployment

A `product deployment` refers to the hardware infrastructure aspect of the product. As explained in the
[product section](/references/core-concepts.html#product), the
organisation's `proto` repository contains a directory for each product, in which the infrastructure requirements used
within the neurons are specified.

Before _deploying_ a `product`, it first needs to be _built_ (see `alis product build -h`), which increments the
semantic versioning and applies the **product level** (ie. not those within the `neurons`) Terraform specification
within the `product` Google Cloud project.

When a `product` is _deployed_ (see `alis product deploy -h`), the **product level** (ie. not those within the `neurons`)
Terraform files are used to apply the infrastructure specification, the end `product` being the deployment environment
reflecting the specification in the `*.tf` files. Once deployed, each `product deployment` has its own _Google Cloud
project_.

### Neuron deployment

A `neuron deployment` refers to a specific version of a `neuron` that is operational within a specific `product deployment`,
thereby being a _child resource_ of a `product deployment`.

Before _deploying_ a `neuron`, it first needs to be _built_ (see `alis neuron build -h`). During the build process,
the semantic versioning is incremented and deployment package is created from the source code and the Terraform specification:
1. The hash of the latest commit is captured such as to have a snapshot of the Terraform specification at the
    point in time the `build` was called.
2. The Dockerfile(s) in the `neuron` repo is executed on _[Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build)_ to build the
images from the `neuron` source code, which is stored in the _[Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry)_.

When the `neuron` is _deployed_ to a specific `product deployment` (see `alis neuron deploy -h`), the `neuron` level
Terraform specification is applied in the _Google Cloud project_ of the respective `product deployment`. This
specification will typically contain services which point to the image in the artifact registry that was built when
running `alis neuron build ...`.

A `product deployment` may consist of all the `neurons` within a `product` or a subset thereof. Three common patterns
have emerged from builders on **alis.exchange** which are discussed in the following section.

### Common deployment patterns

To demonstrate the three most typical deployment patterns, consider the example, depicted in the image, of a `product`
consisting of three `neurons`.

![](../.vuepress/public/assets/images/ExchangeConceptsProductNeuron.svg)

### Pattern 1: Full product deployment

The first pattern is where a `product` is deployed having all the `neurons`. This is typically used where a `product` provided
to clients is required to have all the functionality across all the `neurons` and be independent of other `neuron
deployments`.

### Pattern 2: Limited features product deployment

The second pattern is where a `product` is deployed having a subset of `neurons`. This is typically used where a `product`
may have a range of features that may individually be purchased by clients and therefore want to limit those available
in a given `product deployment`.

The image depicts an example where two clients have access to two different `product deployments`. The `product` having the
core functionality as part of `Neuron 1` and additional features being available with the other `neurons`. In the first case,
the client would have the functionality provided by the core `Neuron 1` and the extended functionality of `Neuron 2`.
In the second case, the client would have the functionality provided by the core `Neuron 1` and the extended
functionality of `Neuron 3`.

### Pattern 3: Interdependent neurons product deployment

The final pattern is where multiple `product deployments` may have the need to access a single `neuron` version. This
may be due to various use cases including:
- The shared `neuron` containing a common data set that all `product deployements` are dependent on.<br />
    _Example_: A common set of core financial instrument resources.
- Architecturally, deciding to use a single Google Cloud product instance to perform the logic of the neuron.<br />
    _Example_: A <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/overview" targer="_blank">Cloud BigTable</a> instance
    that is shared by other services to store information. <br />
	The reasoning being that each BigTable instance is billed.
    Therefore, using a single, shared instance with tight access control provides the same functionality but at a much
    lower cost.

The image depicts an example where `neuron deployments` of multiple `product deployments` make use of an individual,
shared `neuron deployment`.
