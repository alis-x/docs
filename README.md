## Contribution

This site is built with VuePress. Site content is written in Markdown format located in docs. For simple edits, you can directly edit the file on GitHub and generate a Pull Request.

For local development, fork the repo and use npm as the preferred package manager:

```bash
$ npm i

$ npm run docs:dev
```

## Working on the content
